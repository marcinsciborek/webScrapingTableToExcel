This code is for downloading tables from websites to .csv file.
Code can be adjusted to other tables/websites - in this example, I used table from Wikipedia website.

You can open .csv file in Excel - if data is split in one column in Excel, you should follow this steps:
1. Open Excel and go to 'Data'
2. Click on 'Get Data' or 'From Text' - depends on version
3. Select .csv file
4. Select delimiter (e.g. Tab)
5. Click ok
